Changes between 2.0.0.1 and 2.1.0.0
-----------------------------------

* PRE_REQUISITE: Ensure you are using the latest update of Apama v10.1

* NEW: Merger Analytic - Merges fields from two Data streams or appends static data values to individual parameters
* NEW: Mapper Analytic - Maps a value from one parameter field to another value or field.
* NEW: Repeater Analytic - Republishes a Data event based on a periodic update if no other Data was received that forces an immediate update
* NEW: Throttler Analytic - Allows a stream of Data events to be throttled, for example, so that repeated events are ignored
* NEW: FFTAnalysis Analytic - Performs a Fast Fourier Transformation on a streaming sample of Data events
* NEW: Distance Analytic - Calculates the Distance between consecutive latitude/longitude data events
* NEW: Speed Analytic - Calculates the Speed based on the time between consecutive latitude/longitude data events
* NEW: Expression Analytic - Allows uses to define a mathematical expression to be calculated inline
* NEW: Logger Analytic - Logs all received Data events to the log file for diagnostics or auditing purposes
* FIXED: MinMax Analytic calculation did not clear old values after time window expired

Changes between 2.0.0.0 and 2.0.0.1
-----------------------------------
* FIXED:  Sum Analytic calculation was incorrect in some cases
* UPDATE: Sum Analytic can now add based on dValue, xValue, yValue, zValue Data event fields
* UPDATE: Detector Analytics now add a value to the Data event parameters indicating which Analytic generated the anomaly
* UPDATE: Spike Analytic now allows Users to defines a number of points before anomalous events are generated. This allows the average and standard deviation corridor to settle before anomalies are generated
* UPDATE: Suppressor Analytic can now be started as "suppressed"
* UPDATE: Average Analytic now supports the "bySourceId" parameter to allow generating a moving average partioned by the "sourceId" parameter (which was the previous behaviour) or to ignore it as part of the calculation

Changes between 1.0.9.0 and 2.0.0.0
-----------------------------------
* PRE_REQUISITE: Ensure you are using the latest update of Apama 9.12.
* UPDATE: The Industry Analytics Kit was originally termed the "IoT Analytics Kit", and while 
  the analytics themselves still provide the same (and extended) use cases for IoT, 
  they are also used in other industries. So, we have taken the opportunity to genericise 
  some of the keywords used in the names of the components and the events used to define them. 
  Below is the list of changes between the IoT Analytics Kit and the current Industry Analytics Kit.
  
  There are no behavioural changes, just name changes. Refactoring or search and replace would be
  the simplest. Replacing the IoT Analytics Kit bundle with the new Industry Analytics Kit bundle 
  will highlight any errors within Software AG Designer tool.
    
* UPDATE: Changed the package from "com.industry.iot" to "com.industry.analytics"
* UPDATE: Arranged the Analytics into functional groups, and modified their package names to reflect their grouping
* UPDATE: Changed the name of the Event Types:
    Transformer --> Analytic (com.industry.analytics.analytic)
    Measure --> Data (com.industry.analytics.data)
* UPDATE: Changed the names of some of the fields in the Data (Measure) event type
    name --> streamName
    assetId --> sourceId
* UPDATE: Renamed some Analytics (ie Transformers)
    Aggregator --> Combiner
    Sorted Merge --> Sorter
    Quasher --> Suppressor
    Moving Average --> Average
    Variance --> Volatility
    Threshold Breach --> Threshold
    Baseline Threshold --> Drift
    Nominal Range --> Spike
    PMML --> Prediction
    Simulator --> Data Simulator
* UPDATE: Replaced the AssetService with an improved DataSourceService for management of sources of raw data
* UPDATE: Changed the names of some of the configuration parameters of the Filter Analytic, but they operate the same way:
    sensorsForAssets --> sourceId_OnlyLeafNodes
    assetsAndChildren --> sourceId_AllChildren
* UPDATE: Modified the Spike Analytic to use special output channel name prefixes for optional output
          channels rather than specifying them via configuration parameters.
* UPDATE: Simplified the Filter and Sorter Analytics to only allow single input and output channels. If multi-channel 
          support is required, applications should use multiple instances of these Analytics or the Combiner/Duplicator Analytics.
* UPDATE: Simplified the DataViewer and MemoryStore Analytics so you do not define an output channel as the 
          name of the Dataview or MemoryStore table. The input channel name is used by default, which can be optionally 
          overridden by using a configuration parameter.
* UPDATE: All Analytic parameter values are case-insensitive now, making it easier to configure everything.
* NEW: Added a VersioningService - Allows applications to check the current version of the Industry Analytics Kit, 
       and check if the version the application wants to use is compatible with the current version.
* NEW: Deployment script to improve ease of use in integration with SoftwareAG Designer
* NEW: Duplicator Analytic - Added a new Analytic that takes a single input Data stream and duplicates the Data event onto multiple output channels
* NEW: Min/Max Analytic - Added a new Analytic that calculates the min/max values for a Data stream over a defined time window.
* NEW: Peer Analysis Analytic - Added a new Analytic that calculates the "normal" range of values for a Data stream over a defined time window.
* NEW: Sum Analytic - Added a new Analytic that calculates the moving sum values for a Data stream over a defined time window or number of events.
* NEW: Mode Analytic - Added a new Analytic that calculates the statistical mode for a Data stream over a defined time window.
* NEW: Data Simulator Analytic - Added a new Analytic that generates Data events based on a configurable pattern type (e.g. brownian motion, random, sine wave, sawtooth, etc).
* NEW: Added new sample for creating a custom Analytic 
* NEW: Added new sample for demonstrating the Peer Analysis Analytic.


Changes between 1.0.8 and 1.0.9
-------------------------------

* PRE_REQUISITE: Ensure you are using the latest update of Apama 9.12.
* NEW: DataViewer Transform.
* NEW: reset action in Transform interface, to allow transform states to be reset back to their starting state.
* NEW: RESET, START and STOP added to TransformManagement.
* UPDATE: TransportObject init() API altered to take advantage of the new ifpresent EPL functionality.
* UPDATE: TransportObject initMultiple() has been removed.
* UPDATE: BasicSample changed to use DataViewer instead of MemoryStore.
* UPDATE: BasicSample changed to use Simulator instead of custom simulation.
* UPDATE: DataViewer and MemoryStore list table now also includes the actual dataview name as well as the reference name.
* UPDATE: DataViewer now deletes the DataView definition when an instance of the transform is deleted.
* FIXED: ThresholdBreach was using the same direction across all assets for the CROSSING mode.


Changes between 1.0.7 and 1.0.8
-------------------------------

* PRE-REQUISITE: Now requires Apama 9.12.
* NEW: GeoFence Transform.
* NEW: Spread Transform.
* NEW: TransformManagement event with DELETE command, allowing existing transformers to be deleted dynamically.
* RENAMED: DataViewer Transform to MemoryStore Transform.
* UPDATE: ThresholdBreach now adds a param specifying in which direction the breach was registered.
* UPDATE: Gradient and PMML transforms now pass through parameters in configurable fashion from their input Measures.
* UPDATE: modelName is now mandatory for the PMML Transform due to change in the API with Apama 9.12.
* Update: decimal types are now stored as decimals in the MemoryStore Transform instead of as floats.
